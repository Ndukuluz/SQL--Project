# 📚 SQL Library Management System Project

This project is part of my Data Analytics portfolio.  
It demonstrates my SQL skills by building and querying a **Library Management System** database in MySQL.

---

## 🛠️ What I Learned
- **DDL (Data Definition Language)** → Creating tables and defining relationships.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** → Inserting, updating, and deleting records.
- **DQL (Data Query Language)** → Writing queries to explore and analyze data.

---

## 📂 Project Files
- `ddl.sql` → Contains CREATE TABLE statements (Books, Borrowers).
- `dml.sql` → Contains INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements with sample data.
- `library_management.sql` → Contains queries (from simple to advanced: filtering, joins, aggregation, etc.).
- `ppt/` → Folder with presentation slides and screenshots of queries/results.

## 📊 Database Schema
The database has 2 main tables:

**Books**  
- BookID (Primary Key)  
- Title  
- Author  
- Genre  
- YearPublished  

**Borrowers**  
- BorrowerID (Primary Key)  
- BorrowerName  
- BookID (Foreign Key → Books.BookID)  
- BorrowDate  
- ReturnDate

## 🔍 Example Queries
Here are some of the queries included in the project:
- Find all books published after 2010.
- Count how many books are in each genre.
- Show borrowers who haven’t returned their books yet.
- Find the most borrowed book.
- List each borrowed book with its borrower’s name.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add more tables (e.g., Authors, Staff).
- Use advanced SQL (CTEs, Window Functions).
- Connect this database to **Power BI** to create dashboards.
